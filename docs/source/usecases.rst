The overall motive behind this is to improve operational effectiveness, decrease costs, and further strengthen the relationships with the insured. The following can be achieved with a structured storage:

		3. Improving provider directory accuracy The technology’s decentralized consensus can be leveraged by the unique provider directories to allow providers and insurers for easy and quick update listings

		4. Simplifying the application process by making it more client-centric Providing an easier-to-access, more comprehensive set of insurance records on a Blockchain can help in infusing comfort and peace of mind into what, for many, which is now an intrusive and often discouraging application process.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCES
---------------------


**Corporate Compliances**

		One of the most tempting features of Blockchain from the compliance perspective is its practical immutability. As soon as data is saved onto the chain, it cannot be modified or removed. This is one of the major feature making Blockchain used as the document or proof for the transfer of any digital asset.

		Recordskeeper tends to apprehend pain points for financial institutions and regulators. Saving one shared permanent record on the Blockchain will reduce the need for duplicacy, thus elevating the need for both financial firms and regulators, ultimately which can turn up as tremendous cost saving for the entire industry. It would also expedite the regulatory review process since there would no longer be a need for reconciliation. A business unit can monitor regulatory feeds and update their records based on regulations in the Recordskeeper Blockchain. Each compliance document is either acknowledged or dismissed based on the regulations. Every approved document is stored in the Recordskeeper Ledger and can be shared and verified when required.

		Academic certificates can be easily issued and verified using Recordskeeper Ledger. The educational authorities issue a certificate and give the user a receipt which they can share with any third party to prove the authenticity of the certificate. When the third party receives this receipt, they can easily check it’s authenticity on the Recordskeeper ledger.

		Additionally, RecordsKeeper adds following features in this medium in the following ways:

		Transparency – Both the parties who are interested in viewing academic credentials can see it on the RecordsKeeper blockchain. This ensures that only people with ownership rights can make decisions about who has access this information.
		Immutability – Blockchains are the most secure source for storing the information right now. They rely on the integrity of the network to ensure the authenticity of the stored information. So, the Academics certificates stored on the RecordsKeeper blockchain are immutable.
		Disintermediation – Using Recordskeeper blockchain to store and share academic credentials helps us bypass the need for a central controlling authority that manages and keeps records. This makes the overall process of storing credentials more trustworthy as there are no middlemen involved.
		Collaboration – Once the information becomes available on the RecordsKeeper blockchain, it is much easier to ascribe ownership and therefore, safer to share the information without the fear of this information getting compromised.

		Tracking purchase orders, change orders, receipts, shipment notifications, or other trade-related documents
		Assigning or verifying certifications or certain properties of physical products; for example determining if a food product is organic or fair trade
		Linking physical goods to serial numbers, barcodes, digital tags like RFID, etc.
		Sharing information about manufacturing process, assembly, delivery, and maintenance of products with suppliers and vendors.
		Each unit has a set of compliance which needs to be followed. Recordskeeper, can make sure that compliances are being followed, throughout the process. At each unit, the current status of the supply and it’s related compliance is approved and recorded in the ledger by the concerned unit, thus helping in maintaining transparency among all units. The Recordskeeper will maintain copies of receipts, orders or notification etc and will make sure that their integrity is maintained.

		Data sharing has always been prone to attacks, hackers are always present in a search for ways to hack any data through means of channel diversion or accessing the encrypted transferred data. RecordsKeeper can be used for creating a system which will help in sharing data over the network securely. This system will encrypt the file with receiver’s public key before sharing. Once the receiver receives the file, they can decrypt it using their private keys. At each stage, the Recordskeeper will maintain the metadata of the file and keep track of all the changes made in it. Thus, both the parties can verify if a document has been manipulated or not.

		The primary benefit of using RecordsKeeper blockchain for File sharing is the safety of the data. Information present on RecordsKeeper blockchain is immutable and unalterable which makes it safe and secure. In case of the RecorsKeeper blockchain, if a user uploaded the file then the hash of the file gets stored in the blockchain and then the user can verify the authenticity of the file by using the hash and claim the ownership.

		Identification documents or licenses verification is a tedious but mandatory job for all citizens. These documents can easily be faked, which has a direct impact on a number of government agendas, for example, governments are not able to implement health or food policies efficiently due to incorrect data recorded. Recordskeeper can effectively be used as a solution for this problem, records with proper and unalterable information can be saved over the RecordsKeeper Ledger which can be easily accessed when required.

		This information is safe with Recordskeeper as the digest of the document is saved in the Ledger which when altered, gets completely changed making the verification process effortless. Recordskeeper platform aims to significantly reduce the time and resources spent on cross verification of the identification documents. Once the data gets stored in the RecordsKeeper blockchain by the document hash user can claim ownership on the file. By this mechanism, the chances of generating the fake documents get reduced. So, with the help of RecordsKeeper we can increase the authenticity of government identification documents.

These records are used to protect owners’ rights, i.e., in case of theft, helps in resolving disputes, makes sure of whether ownership is correctly transferred to a new owner after the sale and helps in preventing sale fraud. Thus, it is necessary to maintain correctness, as well as completeness of this information to avoid unauthorized and fraudulent changes.

		Currently, people have to rely on a trusted third party. E.g., a government agency might be responsible for keeping track of ownership information. Sometimes, these records are not preserved in a systematic way.Recordskeeper solves this problem completely, as it provides a complete way of sanctioning, approving and saving all sorts of asset information which can never be falsified or altered.

		The current process for clearing a land deed is very complex and requires house buyers to hire a middleman to clear the land deed for them. This is a complete waste of resources, both human and monetary, to accomplish something that can easily be done with the help of a public blockchain i.e. RecordsKeeper. In addition to making the process a whole lot more efficient, registering land deeds on a public blockchain also ensures that owner information cannot be manipulated in any way, adding another layer of security for the homeowners.
