Enterprise KYC
--------------

**Storing and Verifying Enterprise KYC/Governement IDs over RecordsKeeper Blockchain**

KYC procedures and Compliance have become increasingly important in the banking industry as regulators are keeping track of banks by noting down with whom they are doing business. It is done to avoid potential money laundering or terrorist financing. Currently, institutions offering financial or professional services are obliged to follow time-consuming and expensive practices for each new customer. These KYC processes can delay business as it can take up to 30 to 50 days to complete satisfactorily. Some estimates showed that global spending on AML compliance alone is close to $10 billion. Banks are also coming under pressure from various investors and analysts to reduce cost, but many expect that the compliance budgets to increase in the coming years rather than to decrease.

The adoption of Blockchain technology could lead to the reduction of AML and KYC costs thanks to its cross-institution client verification capability, as well as its effectiveness in monitoring and analyzing data required for AML and KYC checks. Recordskeeper solves this use case entirely, without the need to maintain physical documents. The authenticity of these documents can be easily verified because of the nature of the Blockchain. Recordskeeper streams can keep records of various identification cards, which can be shared and validated when required by any enterprise unit or the government agencies.

With Recordskeeper Blockchain, the verification of a client or the legality of a transaction could take place just once, with the final result cryptographically stored in the Recordskeeper Blockchain. Organizations such as banks or administration services providers would be able to get rid of the multistep AML and KYC processes. More specifically, all of the information related to a client would become available to organizations with the appropriate permissions via a distributed database that would be considered a single source of “truth.” So, when some bank has verified a new client, then they can put the client’s data on Recordskeeper Blockchain which can then also be accessed by other banks and accredited organizations, like loan providers and insurance companies, without the need for the KYC process to be started all over again by another party. These parties would know that the client’s information has been independently audited and verified by various miners so that no more KYC checks are necessary.

Academic certificates can be easily issued and verified using Recordskeeper Ledger. The educational authorities issue a certificate and give the user a receipt which they can share with any third party to prove the authenticity of the certificate. When the third party receives this receipt, they can easily check it’s authenticity on the Recordskeeper ledger.

Additionally, RecordsKeeper adds following features in this medium in the following ways:

**Transparency** – Both the parties who are interested in viewing academic credentials can see it on the RecordsKeeper blockchain. This ensures that only people with ownership rights can make decisions about who has access this information.
		
**Immutability** – Blockchains are the most secure source for storing the information right now. They rely on the integrity of the network to ensure the authenticity of the stored information. So, the Academics certificates stored on the RecordsKeeper blockchain are immutable.

**Disintermediation** – Using Recordskeeper blockchain to store and share academic credentials helps us bypass the need for a central controlling authority that manages and keeps records. This makes the overall process of storing credentials more trustworthy as there are no middlemen involved.
		
**Collaboration** – Once the information becomes available on the RecordsKeeper blockchain, it is much easier to ascribe ownership and therefore, safer to share the information without the fear of this information getting compromised.

Recording the quantity and transfer of assets – like pallets, trailers, containers, etc. – as they move between supply chain nodes
Tracking purchase orders, change orders, receipts, shipment notifications, or other trade-related documents
Assigning or verifying certifications or certain properties of physical products; for example determining if a food product is organic or fair trade
Linking physical goods to serial numbers, barcodes, digital tags like RFID, etc.
Sharing information about manufacturing process, assembly, delivery, and maintenance of products with suppliers and vendors.
Each unit has a set of compliance which needs to be followed. Recordskeeper, can make sure that compliances are being followed, throughout the process. At each unit, the current status of the supply and it’s related compliance is approved and recorded in the ledger by the concerned unit, thus helping in maintaining transparency among all units. The Recordskeeper will maintain copies of receipts, orders or notification etc and will make sure that their integrity is maintained. RecordsKeeper helps you set the rules for recording the data thus you can set the compliance conditions and only when the conditions are meet, RecordsKeeper will allow the user to share the data.

Data sharing has always been prone to attacks, hackers are always present in a search for ways to hack any data through means of channel diversion or accessing the encrypted transferred data. RecordsKeeper can be used for creating a system which will help in sharing data over the network securely. This system will encrypt the file with receiver’s public key before sharing. Once the receiver receives the file, they can decrypt it using their private keys. At each stage, the Recordskeeper will maintain the metadata of the file and keep track of all the changes made in it. Thus, both the parties can verify if a document has been manipulated or not.

The primary benefit of using RecordsKeeper blockchain for File sharing is the safety of the data. Information present on RecordsKeeper blockchain is immutable and unalterable which makes it safe and secure. In case of the RecorsKeeper blockchain, if a user uploaded the file then the hash of the file gets stored in the blockchain and then the user can verify the authenticity of the file by using the hash and claim the ownership.

Identification documents or licenses verification is a tedious but mandatory job for all citizens. These documents can easily be faked, which has a direct impact on a number of government agendas, for example, governments are not able to implement health or food policies efficiently due to incorrect data recorded. Recordskeeper can effectively be used as a solution for this problem, records with proper and unalterable information can be saved over the RecordsKeeper Ledger which can be easily accessed when required.

This information is safe with Recordskeeper as the digest of the document is saved in the Ledger which when altered, gets completely changed making the verification process effortless. Recordskeeper platform aims to significantly reduce the time and resources spent on cross verification of the identification documents. Once the data gets stored in the RecordsKeeper blockchain by the document hash user can claim ownership on the file. By this mechanism, the chances of generating the fake documents get reduced. So, with the help of RecordsKeeper we can increase the authenticity of government identification documents.

These records are used to protect owners’ rights, i.e., in case of theft, helps in resolving disputes, makes sure of whether ownership is correctly transferred to a new owner after the sale and helps in preventing sale fraud. Thus, it is necessary to maintain correctness, as well as completeness of this information to avoid unauthorized and fraudulent changes.

Currently, people have to rely on a trusted third party. E.g., a government agency might be responsible for keeping track of ownership information. Sometimes, these records are not preserved in a systematic way.Recordskeeper solves this problem completely, as it provides a complete way of sanctioning, approving and saving all sorts of asset information which can never be falsified or altered.

The current process for clearing a land deed is very complex and requires house buyers to hire a middleman to clear the land deed for them. This is a complete waste of resources, both human and monetary, to accomplish something that can easily be done with the help of a public blockchain i.e. RecordsKeeper. In addition to making the process a whole lot more efficient, registering land deeds on a public blockchain also ensures that owner information cannot be manipulated in any way, adding another layer of security for the homeowners.
